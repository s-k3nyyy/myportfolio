                 instructions for preparations
                </p>
                <li>
                    Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your pizza dough recipe or on the store-bought dough packaging.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare your pizza dough. If using store-bought dough, follow the instructions on the packaging. If making your own, roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut the pizza dough into 12-inch slices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza pan or baking sheet lined with parchment paper or sprinkled with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake the pizza for 15-18 minutes, or until the pizza is tender.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the dough from the oven and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle cheese evenly over the sauce. Use as much or as little cheese as you like, depending on your preference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle mushrooms evenly over the sauce. Use as much or as little mushrooms as you like, depending on your preference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake according to the dough recipe or package instructions, typically for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!
